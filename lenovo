1) head ref :  the reference to the most recent commit in the current branch
2) base branch :the default branch in a repository is the base branch for new pull requests and code commits.
By default, GitHub names the default branch main in any new repository. 
You can change the default branch for an existing repository.
3) commit/git hash : You'll see a list of all the commits in your repository, 
along with their commit hashes, author information, and commit messages. 
The commit hash is a long string of characters that uniquely identifies each commit. 
You can copy and paste the commit hash when you need to reference a specific commit.
4) git log : To checkout a previous commit, 
you will use the Git checkout command followed by the commit hash you retrieved from your Git log.
